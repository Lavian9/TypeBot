          Typebot is one of the best chatbot builders with its intelligent
          features and drag-and-drop simplicity. Its UI/UX is an earthly
          paradise...
          <br />
          What&apos;s even more important is the person who stands behind it. He
          guarantees that the platform will work and progress for a long time.

          Thanks to typebot I can finally make site forms much more modern and I
          can collect information that I would have missed before. Also ,thanks
          to Baptiste, the service is always evolving and has excellent
          assistance not only in solving but also in listening to suggestions
          and putting it into action.
          <br />

          Thank you thank you and thank you again .
